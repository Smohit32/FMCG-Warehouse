Amazon, a global leader in e-commerce, operates an extensive network of warehouses across various regions to ensure timely delivery and efficient stock management. However, the company has been facing significant challenges in maintaining efficient warehouse operations. These challenges include frequent stockouts, delays in deliveries, and escalating operational costs. To address these issues, Amazon's management has tasked us with analysing the warehouse data. The goal is to identify the key issues affecting warehouse efficiency and to provide actionable insights that can help streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve overall service levels. By leveraging data analysis, we aim to uncover patterns and bottlenecks in the current system and recommend strategic improvements to enhance warehouse performance.
### FMCG-Warehouse

####Problem Statement 
Amazon is experiencing inefficiencies in its warehouse operations. These inefficiencies are affecting the supply chain, leading to stockouts, delivery delays, and increased costs. Your task is to analyse warehouse data to uncover the root causes of these issues and propose data-driven solutions to optimize warehouse performance.

####Tools Used for Data Analysis
In analyzing the FMCG warehouse dataset, we utilized a variety of powerful tools and libraries in Python to gain insights and visualize the data. Here is a brief overview of the key tools and their purposes:
1 . Python
Python served as the primary programming language for this analysis. It offers a comprehensive ecosystem for data analysis and visualization, making it an ideal choice for handling complex datasets.
2.Pandas
Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library in Python. 
3.NumPy
NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python.
4.Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a widely used plotting library in Python.

####Key Insights 
1. Performance Variability:
Significant variability in metrics such as refill requests, storage issues, and breakdowns across warehouses.
Infrastructure Gaps:
2.Lack of reliable electric supply and temperature regulation in some warehouses.
Operational Challenges:
3.Presence of transport and storage issues indicating logistical and infrastructural challenges.
Compliance and Maintenance:
4.Variation in the frequency of government checks and breakdown incidents, highlighting the need for regular maintenance and compliance.
Geographic and Capacity Distribution:
5.Warehouses are spread across different zones and vary in capacity sizes, affecting operational strategies and logistics.

####Conclusion
The analysis of the FMCG warehouse dataset reveals critical insights into the operational and infrastructural aspects of the warehouses. The findings highlight significant performance variability, with certain warehouses facing more challenges in terms of refill requests, storage issues, and breakdowns. Infrastructure gaps, such as the lack of reliable electric supply and temperature regulation, are evident in some warehouses, potentially impacting their operational efficiency and product quality.
Operational challenges, including transport and storage issues, suggest the need for improvements in logistics and infrastructure. The variation in the frequency of government checks and breakdown incidents underscores the importance of regular maintenance and compliance with regulatory standards to minimize operational disruptions.
By addressing these identified issues through targeted improvements in infrastructure, process optimizations, regular maintenance, and logistics optimization, the company can enhance the efficiency and reliability of its warehouse operations. This, in turn, will lead to better service delivery, improved customer satisfaction, and a more robust supply chain.
