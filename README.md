Amazon, a global leader in e-commerce, operates an extensive network of warehouses across various regions to ensure timely delivery and efficient stock management. However, the company has been facing significant challenges in maintaining efficient warehouse operations. These challenges include frequent stockouts, delays in deliveries, and escalating operational costs. To address these issues, Amazon's management has tasked us with analysing the warehouse data. The goal is to identify the key issues affecting warehouse efficiency and to provide actionable insights that can help streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve overall service levels. By leveraging data analysis, we aim to uncover patterns and bottlenecks in the current system and recommend strategic improvements to enhance warehouse performance.
